Note for Reviewer -
## To Run the app Locally-

1- Go to main directory **siera-performance-review** where package.json is & install frontend dependencies by running `npm install` & then `npm start`

2- Similarly, Go to **backend** directory, install backend dependencies by running `npm install` & then run `nodemon server`.

**Assumptions** -
You have node, npm installed in your machine.



**Note** -

1- For Admin Panel, visit http://localhost:3000/admin

2- For Employee Panel, visit http://localhost:3000/employee

3- Due to time constraint, I couldn't complete the Employee panel but I have tried my best to finish the Admin panel atleast.

4- You might see some code duplicacy because not enough time left for Code refactoring.

5- I have added some employees during testing. You can test by adding new employees through admin panel.
